# PhD Thesis

For the sake of learning `LaTeX`, I copied/pasted my PhD thesis written in 2012 and re-build the whole document.

The file should be compiled using `XeLaTex` + `Bibtex`.

The original thesis can be found via [this Manchester eScholar link](https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:182817).
